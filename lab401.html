  <h1>Mid Autumn Crickets</h1>
     <body>
       
       <p> The crickets are still singing, filling the evenings and nights with their beautiful song. Though I know they are doing so, probably, just trying to get it on, and not meant for me. Many songs by people are likely that way too. Still, the beauty of the melodies persist. They have began singing more in the day lately, the days are becoming cooler. Soon, their song will go away. Yielding to the rich reprieve and sounds of late autumn.</p>

  <h2>The Coming of Crunch Season</h2>
     <body>
       
       <p> With the ebbing of the crickets song, we know that the crunch is soon upon us. The crunch, known widely to my kind, is that of the fallen leaf. As the leaves fall and crisp, their swirling will fill the silence. When the crunching season hits in full, then most steps can be filled with the satisfying sound!</p>
